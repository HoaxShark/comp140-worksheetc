REVISED:

Alt controller game idea:

Infinite runner with walls that need to be turned off before the player hits them.
Walls will be colour coordinated to the controller, needed the correct matching 
colour input to turn them off.
Inputs made that dont match a wall on screen increase the the runner speed.
This can be good or bad depending as you can get a higher score faster, but also 
increases difficulty.

Controller idea:

Glove with bend resitance sensors on each finger,
fingers designated colour using fabric on the fingers,
bend fingers to input.
